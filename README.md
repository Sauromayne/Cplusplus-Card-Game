# C plus plus Card Game
 Console C++ "War" Card Game
 
## Skills Learned:
1. C++ Programming: Through this project, I gained a strong understanding of C++ language features, including classes, objects, functions, and data structures, and applied them to create a fully functional console game.

2. Software Development: The project allowed me to practice the software development lifecycle, including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and debugging. It showcases my ability to transform a concept into a tangible software product.

3. Modularization: I learned how to break down the codebase into modular components, using header files to separate interface declarations from implementation details. This approach improves code organization, readability, and maintainability, making it easier to manage and update the project in the future.

4. Code Reusability: By modularizing the code, I demonstrated my ability to create reusable components. Parts of the game logic or functionalities can be easily extracted and reused in other projects or extended to support additional features.

5. Problem-Solving: Developing a game involves solving various challenges, such as implementing game rules, managing player input, and handling game state transitions. This project allowed me to enhance my problem-solving skills by finding efficient and elegant solutions to these challenges.
